Title: Grid away, grid ahoy!
The Mission
Recreate the layout 
Try to get as close as possible without writing CSS
Add a navigation sidebar to the left, with some  links
Style the navigation bar using only the framework I selected
Make the grid responsive and on mobile screens (< 768px) make sure the sidenav disappears completely.
When you move with your mouse over the "learn more" button, show a tooltip with some extra text. You can use the bootstrap tooltips for this
